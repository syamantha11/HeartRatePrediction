# Heart Attack Prediction


A Machine Learning model which helps to Prediction of Heart Attack. A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, evaluation and MLR assumptions validity steps explained in detail.





## Features that are Included to Predict

1. Blood Pressure
2. Cholestrol
3. Maximum Heart Rate
4. Old Peak
5. Age
6. Sex
7. ChestPain
8. Exercise

## Walkthrough Project

1. Data Understanding and Exploration: 

    We will understand the data types of the features and analysis of the features.

2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Preparation: Feature Engineering and Scaling:
4. Creating ML model using two algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest
5. Hyper Parameter Tuning
6. Balancing the Dataset and creating model
7. Validate and Test the model

## Visualizations

1. Box Plot - Is used find out Outliers of the features
2. Distplot - Is used to find out Distribution of the Data in Feature

## Deployment

To deploy this project we used Flask API and Heroku 

Flask API s a web framework for Python, meaning that it provides functionality for building web applications, including managing HTTP requests and rendering templates.

Heroku - Platform as a Service
